# Rebirth — agent guide

This is a single-user (Lou only) Next.js App Router PWA with a Drizzle +
Postgres backend, Dexie + sync-engine local-first layer, and an MCP server
that exposes the same surface to AI agents.

## Ship policy: direct-to-main, no PRs

**This project ships straight to `main`. Do not create PRs.** Lou is the only
user and will not review them — branches with open PRs accumulate and work gets
lost. This overrides the default `/ship` skill behavior.

When Lou says "ship" / "deploy" / "send it" / "push it":
1. If currently on a feature branch, merge it into `main` locally first
   (`git checkout main && git merge --no-ff <branch>`), then delete the branch
   (local + remote). If on `main` already, skip this.
2. Run the project's existing ship steps (tests, version bump, CHANGELOG, commit).
3. `git push origin main` — done. No `gh pr create`.
4. If the `/ship` skill tries to open a PR, stop and push to main directly.

Exception: if Lou explicitly says "open a PR" or "make a PR for this", do that
instead — but the default is direct-to-main.

When you find a feature branch sitting around with unmerged commits, surface it
to Lou ("branch X has N unmerged commits — merge to main or drop?") rather than
leaving it.

## Nutrition workflow (for MCP agents)

Date conventions:
- All `date` params: `YYYY-MM-DD` in user's local timezone
- All `*_at` params: ISO-8601 with timezone offset
- Compute relative dates ("yesterday") yourself; tools never accept literal `"yesterday"`

Day approval:
- DB stores only `pending` | `approved`. "Logged" is a UI-only derivation for past days that are still pending — you do not need to set it.
- `approve_nutrition_day(date)` flips a date to `approved`. Future dates rejected.
- Already-approved days return idempotent silent success.

Common workflows:
- **"Log my breakfast"** → `search_nutrition_foods(query)` → `log_nutrition_meal({ meal_type: 'breakfast', meal_name, calories, ... })`
- **"Edit yesterday's lunch"** → `list_nutrition_logs(date)` → `update_nutrition_log(uuid, ...)`
- **"Log a whole day at once"** → `bulk_log_nutrition_meals(date, [meals])` (per-item results, partial failures don't abort)
- **"How adherent was last week?"** → `get_nutrition_summary(start_date, end_date)` → returns adherence_pct, streak, approval counts
- **First time touching nutrition?** → `get_nutrition_rules()` returns the full rule set

Updates:
- `update_nutrition_log` uses named params (not a `fields` blob). Server-side whitelist on which columns are editable.
- Errors include a `hint` field naming the next tool to call when applicable.

## Sleep workflow (for MCP agents)

Same date conventions as nutrition (`YYYY-MM-DD` in user's local timezone, which for this single-user app is Australia/Brisbane (AEST, UTC+10, no DST); ISO-8601 with offset for `*_at`).

Tool selection:
- `get_health_snapshot` → current state, last night detail, point-in-time HRV/RHR
- `get_health_sleep_summary` → date-window aggregate: averages, consistency score, HRV trend
- `get_health_series` → single-metric trend chart (e.g., HRV alone)

Common workflows:
- **"How was last night?"** → `get_health_snapshot({ fields: ['sleep_last_night','hrv'] })`
- **"How was last week's sleep?"** → `get_health_sleep_summary({ window_days: 7 })`
- **"Compare this week to last"** → two `get_health_sleep_summary` calls with `start_date` shifted
- **"HRV trend only"** → `get_health_series({ metric: 'hrv', from })`

Notes:
- Naps (in_bed < 4h OR wake < 04:00 Brisbane) are filtered out of summary aggregates and the consistency score.
- Consistency score requires ≥5 main nights with bedtime/waketime envelopes; otherwise `consistency: null`.
- Errors:
  - `{status:'not_connected', reason, message}` — same shape as snapshot's not_connected branch.
  - `{status:'invalid_range'|'invalid_input', message, hint}` — for date / window_days / fields validation.

## Cardio workflow (for MCP agents)

Same date conventions as nutrition / sleep (`YYYY-MM-DD` in user's local timezone for `start_date`/`end_date`).

Tool selection:
- `get_health_workouts` → raw workout records (cardio + strength, source-filterable)
- `get_health_cardio_week` → weekly compliance vs `body_plan.programming_dose` cardio targets, with optional zone-2 / intervals split + 7-day breakdown. Mirrors `get_health_sleep_summary`'s shape.

Common workflows:
- **"Did I hit cardio targets this week?"** → `get_health_cardio_week({ window_days: 7 })`
- **"Compare cardio this week vs last"** → two `get_health_cardio_week` calls with shifted `start_date`
- **"What activity types did I do?"** → `get_health_workouts({ from, to })` + group by `activity_type`

Notes:
- Activity-type classification only in v1.1 (HR-zone path requires per-second HR samples not in `healthkit_workouts` schema yet — see `docs` follow-up). Strength workouts are excluded silently from cardio totals.
- `{status:'no_targets', message}` (200) returns when neither umbrella nor sub-targets are set on `programming_dose` — surface to Lou as "you haven't set cardio targets yet" rather than empty data.
- Errors mirror sleep summary: `{status:'not_connected'|'invalid_input', ...}`.

## Prescription engine note for MCP agents

Lou sees a synthesized weekly prescription on `/feed` (PUSH/REDUCE/DELOAD per priority muscle, with HRT-context lines). Do NOT independently prescribe weekly set/load changes via chat — that creates a "two coaches disagreeing" failure mode the v1.1 prescription card was designed to eliminate.

You may:
- Explain logged facts (sets vs MEV/MAV via `get_sets_per_muscle`, RIR drift, HRV via `get_health_snapshot`, HRT phase via `list_hrt_timeline`).
- Reference what the Week page prescription card shows if the user asks.

You should NOT:
- Generate your own next-week set/load prescription.
- Suggest set/load changes that conflict with what the Week page shows.
- Re-derive the prescription engine's logic with your own heuristics.

The engine is intentionally not exposed via MCP in v1.1 — the verdict stays UI-side; only the inputs are MCP-queryable.

## Strength workflow (for MCP agents)

Canonical muscle taxonomy: 18 slugs. Always use canonical slugs (`chest`, `lats`, `glutes`, etc.) — legacy values like `pectoralis major` are accepted by `find_exercises(muscle_group)` via synonyms, but `create_exercise` rejects non-canonical input with `UNKNOWN_MUSCLE`.

- **First time touching the strength surface?** → `list_muscles()` returns the full taxonomy with optimal ranges, parent_groups, and legacy synonyms.
- **"Did I hit my volume targets this week?"** → `get_sets_per_muscle({ week_offset: 0 })` returns per-muscle set counts vs Schoenfeld 10–20 range. `summary.optimal_count`/`under_count`/`over_count` is the headline; `muscles[]` is the detail.
- **"Total volume this week + per-muscle breakdown"** → `get_weekly_summary({ week_offset: 0 })` returns `total_volume`, `by_muscle[]` (canonical slugs + set_count + kg_volume), and `compliance_pct` vs active plan.
- **"Find a glute exercise"** → `find_exercises({ query: 'romanian deadlift', muscle_group: 'glutes' })` — `muscle_group` accepts canonical slugs OR legacy synonyms.
- **"That set was bad form, exclude it from PB"** → `get_exercise_history(...)` returns `set_uuid` per set → `exclude_set_from_pb({ set_uuid, excluded: true })`. Set stays in workout history / volume / set counts; just stops anchoring PRs. Restore with `excluded: false`.
- **"I was doing this exercise wrong before [date]"** → `exclude_exercise_pb_history_through({ exercise_name | exercise_id, through_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' })`. Inclusive cutoff (sets ON or BEFORE that date are excluded). Pass `dry_run: true` to preview the count first. Returns before/after e1RM PB so you can confirm the change to Lou. Restore the same date range with `excluded: false`.

PB philosophy: only **e1RM** (Epley) is surfaced as a PB. Heaviest-weight and most-reps-in-a-set were dropped (gameable derivatives, not honest progress signals). Don't independently surface "heaviest weight" or "most reps" framings as PRs — `get_exercise_history` returns `estimated_1rm` per session for reps-mode and `longest_hold_seconds` per session for time-mode. Excluded sets respect this: they're returned in `sets[]` with `excluded_from_pb: true` so you can show full history if asked, but are skipped when the per-session e1RM / longest-hold is computed.

Set quality:
- A working set = `is_completed=true AND (reps>=1 OR duration_seconds>0)`. Drop sets count as 1 each.
- **`set_count`** is a raw hit count: every set credits 1 to every muscle in the exercise's `primary_muscles` OR `secondary_muscles` array (counted once per set, even if a muscle appears in both). It answers "did this muscle get worked at all this week?"
- **RIR (Reps in Reserve, 0–5)** is collected per-set in the workout UI as a chip strip below each completed set row (0=failure, 5=5+ left). Stored on `workout_sets.rir`. NULL = not recorded.
- **`effective_set_count`** is the stimulus-weighted variant on every `get_sets_per_muscle` row and `get_weekly_summary.by_muscle` row. Two factors stack:
  - Primary/secondary credit (RP / Helms convention): primary muscle = 1.0, secondary-only = 0.5, in-both = 1.0 (primary wins).
  - RIR credit: RIR 0–3 = 1.0, RIR 4 = 0.5, RIR 5+ = 0.0, RIR NULL = 1.0 (charitable default until corpus exists).
  - Worked example: an RDL set @ RIR 4 contributes 0.25 effective sets to glutes (secondary 0.5 × RIR 0.5) and 0.5 effective sets to hamstrings (primary 1.0 × RIR 0.5).
  - The /feed Muscles This Week tile flags a muscle with a "JUNK" badge when `effective / set_count < 0.6` AND `set_count > 0` — meaning most logged sets were sub-stimulus, either too far from failure OR mostly secondary work.

`coverage` flag on `get_sets_per_muscle` rows: `'none'` means no exercise in the catalog tags this muscle (yet — the audit pass will populate). Until then those muscles can't accumulate sets. UI collapses them into a footer.

## HealthKit type catalog (for any code touching the iOS HealthKit plugin)

The HealthKit request set lives in **`src/lib/healthkit-types.json`** as the single
source of truth. Two artifacts derive from it:

- **`ios/App/App/HealthKitTypes.swift`** — generated. Don't hand-edit. Run
  `npm run gen:healthkit` after changing the JSON.
- **`src/lib/healthkit-catalog.ts`** — imports the JSON directly to populate the
  permissions sheet UI (`HealthKitPermissionsSheet.tsx`).

Drift between Swift and TS is structurally impossible: `npm run test` includes
`src/lib/healthkit-drift.test.ts` which fails CI if the committed Swift file is
out of date with the JSON. `npm run cap:sync` and `npm run ios:device` both run
`gen:healthkit` automatically.

To add a new HealthKit type Rebirth requests: edit the JSON entry array, run
`npm run gen:healthkit`, commit both files, push. iOS will surface a new toggle
on the next `requestPermissions()` call.

The medications entry (`medicationDoseEvent`, iOS 26+) is gated by an
`@available(iOS 26.0, *)` Swift check AND the `rebirth.medications.enabled`
UserDefaults flag (default OFF). Use `HealthKit.setMedicationsEnabled({enabled: true})`
from the JS bridge — that flips the flag AND triggers iOS's per-object
medication chooser. The dose-to-medication-name linkage is unsolved on iOS
26.3.1 (Apple API gap); see `docs/healthkit-medications-name-linkage.md`.
Per-dose `medication_name` is "Unknown medication" today; medication NAMES
come back via the response's `annotatedMedications` array.

## Projection workflow (for MCP agents)

A "projection" is an AI-generated image of Lou (made outside this app, e.g. ChatGPT / Midjourney) showing an aspirational future-self physique. Lou uploads them here so the photos-compare viewer can line them up against real progress photos at the same pose. Schema mirrors `progress_photos` with optional `source_progress_photo_uuid` (link to source) and `target_horizon` (label).

Tool selection:
- `upload_projection_photo` → store image + metadata (pose required).
- `list_projection_photos` → list newest first; filter by pose.
- `delete_projection_photo` → delete row + Vercel Blob.

Common workflows:
- **"Upload a projection of me 6mo leaner, front pose"** → `upload_projection_photo({ pose: 'front', image_base64 (or image_url), target_horizon: '6mo', source_progress_photo_uuid? })`
- **"Show my projections"** → `list_projection_photos({ pose?: 'front', limit: 20 })`
- **"Compare today's progress to my projection"** → `list_progress_photos({ limit: 1 })` + `list_projection_photos({ pose, limit: 1 })` and surface both `blob_url`s.

Notes:
- Pose required (`'front'|'side'|'back'`). Mirrors `progress_photos.pose` so the compare viewer can line them up.
- Optional `source_progress_photo_uuid` links the projection to the photo it was generated from — the compare viewer prefers that pairing if set.
- `target_horizon` is a label (`'3mo'|'6mo'|'12mo'` or freeform), not a date.
- Generation happens outside this app. Lou uploads pre-generated images; there is no in-app image generation.

## Watch workflow (for any code touching the watch companion)

The Apple Watch companion lives in `ios/RebirthWatch/`. It's a native SwiftUI
watchOS 10+ app with a sibling complications widget extension at
`ios/RebirthWatchComplications/`. Both targets depend on the local Swift
package at `RebirthShared/` (Models, API, Keychain, AppGroup, Outbox,
WatchLog).

The watchOS targets are added to `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` programmatically
via `scripts/setup-watch-targets.rb` (idempotent — safe to re-run if
`cap:sync` ever strips them).

### Snapshot push (phone → watch)

`src/lib/watch.ts:buildWatchSnapshot()` converts `LocalWorkoutWithExercises`
into the WC envelope. `src/app/workout/page.tsx` calls
`pushSnapshotToWatch(snapshot)` from a `useEffect` whenever the Dexie live
query changes — every set mutation, exercise add/remove, completion. The
iOS plugin (`WatchConnectivityPlugin.swift`) wraps the snapshot as
`{ schema_version, body }` and calls
`WCSession.updateApplicationContext`. The watch's `WatchSessionStore`
writes the inbound envelope to its own App Group UserDefaults so
cold-launches render instantly.

Snapshot byte budget: hard cap 50KB. History hint = last 1 session only,
max 10 sets per exercise.

`schema_version` is on every payload. Decoders use `decodeIfPresent` for
unknown future fields. If a watch sees `schema_version > supported`, it
shows "Watch needs update" instead of crashing.

### Set completion (watch → phone, no server hop)

**Phone is the single writer to Postgres.** The watch makes no network
calls. When the user confirms a set on the watch, the watch sends a
`{ kind: "watchWroteSet", row: <full echoed CDC row> }` payload via
`WCSession.transferUserInfo` (durable, FIFO, queues if phone unreachable).

Phone-side: `WatchConnectivityPlugin.session(_:didReceiveUserInfo:)`
forwards the payload to JS as a `watchInbound` event.
`src/components/WatchInboundBridge.tsx` (mounted at root layout) calls
`mutations.updateSet()` → Dexie write → existing sync engine pushes to
`/api/sync/push`. The next debounced snapshot push reflects the new state
back to the watch.

The watch echoes EVERY column in the payload — `tag`, `comment`, `is_pr`,
`excluded_from_pb`, etc. Even though the watch doesn't render them, they
must be present so the server-side `EXCLUDED.column` clause doesn't NULL
out fields the watch didn't touch.

There is no API key on the watch, no shared keychain bootstrap, no
watch-side outbox. WC.transferUserInfo's queue + the phone's existing
sync engine cover all the durability we need single-user.

### HealthKit (HKLiveWorkoutBuilder)

Watch starts an `HKWorkoutSession` on first set approval. `HKLiveWorkoutBuilder`
collects HR + active energy in real time. On finish, the workout is
written with `HKMetadataKeyExternalUUID` = Rebirth workout UUID — phone-side
`fetchWorkouts` (`HealthKitPlugin.swift workoutToFullDict`) reads that
key for dedup. No explicit watch→phone WC round-trip needed for the UUID.

### Mock snapshot dev flag

Set `WATCH_MOCK_SNAPSHOT` in the watch target's Other Swift Flags. The
watch bypasses WC and loads `MockSnapshot.midStrengthSession` (3
exercises across reps + time modes). Useful for fast UI iteration without
paired sims.

### Conflict policy (single-user)

Server stamps `updated_at = NOW()` on every push — never trusts client
timestamps for ordering. With phone as single writer, the historical
"phone Dexie + watch direct write race" no longer applies. See
`src/app/api/sync/push/route.ts` comment.

### Rest timer

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED on the watch. Day 13's local-`Timer.publish` ring
was removed because it didn't share state with the phone's
`RestTimerPlugin` (Live Activity / Dynamic Island). The replacement plan
mirrors set completion: phone owns timer state, watch sends WC start /
stopRest / extendRest commands and reads timer state from the snapshot.
See `docs/watch-replan.md`.

### What NOT to do

- Don't have the watch make HTTP calls. Phone is the single writer.
- Don't add a watch-side outbox or API client. WC.transferUserInfo has
  its own delivery queue.
- Don't have the watch call `update_sets` MCP tool for set completion —
  it's a routine-target editor, will wipe set state. The phone applies
  set completions via `mutations.updateSet`.
- Don't try to generate the `HKWorkout.uuid` watch-side — it's HK-assigned
  at finish time. Stamp `HKMetadataKeyExternalUUID` instead.
- Don't reintroduce a watch-owned timer state. Snapshot is truth.
- Don't render an HRV recommendation on the pill ("consider RIR 4"). The
  pill is descriptive only — Week-page prescription engine has the monopoly
  per the prescription-engine note above.
- Don't put new RebirthShared modules at iOS 17+ deployment target — the
  iOS App target is iOS 15. Match it.
